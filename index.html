                Michigan is a beautiful state, located in the upper East side of the USA (although it is still commonly referred to as a midwestern state). It is full of lush forests, many state parks and natural attractions, and a ton of farmland. As well as being surrounded by the Great Lakes, Michigan itself holds many gorgeous lakes including the city of Waterford located in southern Michigan which has 34 lakes! Many people come to Michigan to explore the many state parks and protected natural land. My personal favorite part of living in Michigan is being able to drive on the expressway for many miles and see nothing but large lucious trees on all sides.

                When people think of Michigan they usually only consider Michigans lower peninsula or the “mitten” part of Michigan but, it is composed of two peninsulas, the upper and lower, with a bridge between them. The upper peninsula of Michigan is definitely composed of more lush forests and wildlife including bears and wolves. Visitors may also arrive at the upper peninsula via a ferry ride across the lake, either route will take you to Mackinaw Island, a cute tourist destination located in the photo below.

                Another great location to visit in Michigan that many people don't know about is North / South Manitou Islands. These Islands part of the legend of the “sleeping bear dunes” and located in lake Michigan. These now uninhabited islands still contain the remnants of the buildings of those who used to reside there, including a cemetery! They are a very interesting sight to see if you are someone who likes history, museums, or just a good place to camp and explore! The photo below is one I personally captured on a trip to North Manitou.
