                <h2>History:</h2>
                <p>
                    The origin of the name “Manistee” is not known but it is theorized to be derived from words meaning either "river with islands at its mouth." or "spirit of the woods.". Either of these would be an accurate description of the beautiful natural scenery that can be observed in this city. Manistee was incorporated in 1869 and was first settled by sawmillers. Manistee saw massive growth and wealth from this industry.

                <h2>Population:</h2>
                <p>
                    Today manistee is home to a little more that 6,000 people. This is due to the fact that Manistee is mostly home to forests, rivers, and of course tourist shops meaning it does not have as much room to support residential properties. For those of us who are interested in hiking / camping, or living near water, this can be a major draw to the area.

                <h2>Location</h2>
                <p>
                    Manistee is located on the coast of Lake Michigan, basically in the middle between the top and bottom of the lake. It is approximately 175 miles Northwest of Lansing. Manistees location as well as its scenery makes it the perfect vacation spot for those who love nature and bodies of water.

                <h2>Income:</h2>
                <p>
                    Along with the location being beautiful, Manistees average household income is only around 60k a year. That is almost 10k below the state average, making Manistee seem like a pretty affordable place to live if you are interested.
