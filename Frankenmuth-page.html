                <h2>History:</h2>
                <p>
                    Frankenmuth is primarily designed for businesses and tourism, it has so many things to do including having Michigans largest indoor waterpark and fun center (when it isnt under construction to compete with others) Bronnerâ€™s Christmas Wonderland, the biggest Christmas store at the size of a football field and a half!, as well as many shopping centers and museums. Frankenmuth displays German heritage and architecture in the shops, food, and even the staffs attire at many places.

                <h2>Population:</h2>
                <p>
                    This city only technically has 5,000 residents because it is not designed for residential housing and the housing it does have is typically rented out to tourists as opposed to lived in. Frankenmuth is considered a rural area despite the large amount of people who can be seen walking around and enjoying the attractions around the city.

                <h2>Location:</h2>
                <p> 
                    Frankenmuth is located about 70-80 miles northeast of Lansing. You would think that this town is located near big cities considering it is a destination location for families and vacations, it is not. It is actually surrounded by quite a bit of farmland.

                <h2>Income:</h2>
                <p>
                    Although not many people live here the location is very desirable . The average household income in this town is 80k a year which is about 10k above average for the state of michigan. Obviously, with this town being such a sought after vacation destination it would also be a great place to own a home, so the cost of living is not going to be cheap!
