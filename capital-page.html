                <h2>History:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lansing has been the Capital of Michigan since 1847 taking over the role from Detroit. However, according to Lansings official website, Lansing wasn't even incorporated as a city until 1859. Regardless, the city has plenty of things to do no matter what your interests/hobbies are! For people interested in Art they have Gallaries and Theatres, for those interested in history, Lansing has many history museums, they have multiple farmers markets selling fresh produce, and a huge zoo that has been open for many many years.

                    <p>
                        According to the US Census Bureau in 2023 Lansing was home to over 112,000 people. Although this seems like a lot, Detroit is houses over 633,000 people! Downtown Lansing holds the highest portion of individuals making it an urban area whereas the outskirts of the town have more of a suburban feel.

                    <p>
                        Lansing Michigan is located in the Southern area of the lower peninsula and is pretty central. If you were to hold up your hand as the “mitten” and point about an inch below the center of your palm that would be about where Lansing is.

                <h2>Income:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The average household income in Lansing is about 50k a year when comparing that to the average income of Michigan as a whole (68k a year) it is surprisingly very low. One of the factors influencing the low income of the area may be that it is home to a very large University in Michigan (Michigan State University) and therefore, holds many college students. As we all know college students tend to have a lower income than those outside of college.
